  1-black wolves
<br>
Black wolves are not born as a result of natural reproduction between each other <br>, as a 2008 study at Stanford University found that the mutation responsible for black fur only occurs in dogs,<br>
so black wolves are a result of gray wolves breeding with domestic dogs. This mutation is a dominant trait <br> like dark hair in humans, and is transmitted to most offspring <br>
 It is not entirely clear what is the benefit of black fur for these animals, <br> as it does not seem to help them hunt or hide, but they show a marked improvement in the tolerance of some injuries <br>
 and black wolves are more common in North America compared to the rest of the world. <br> </p>

2-Hybrid wolf
<br>A large percentage of wolves are actually hybrid wolves, so in areas where regular wolves have been largely eliminated coyotes have appeared. <br>
Over the past few years, large numbers of coyotes have moved east to suburban areas and even major cities like New York and Chicago. <br>
Genetic tests conducted on 100 new wolves in the US state of Maine revealed that 22 of them possessed the genes of purebred wolves <br>
and there are also types of bitches that are usually larger than coyotes, but they are smaller than regular wolves <br>
characterized by being extremely skilled, resourceful and able to adapt according to conditions <br>
Surrounding them, but in general they show a fear of human civilization as coyotes,  <br>
and they seem to preserve the instinct of a pure wolf herd of hunting and a high level of aggression.<br> </p>

  <br> 3- Eating the meat of any kind
<br>A common occurrence among wolves is to eat each other's meat, as these carnivores will not miss any opportunity to eat a meal in need <br>
and those wolves that live in some of the most unforgiving natural areas on this planet, may sometimes have to eat sick or injured individuals from The herd <br>
and any wolf that has died is generally a free meal. Wolves caught in traps must be brought in very quickly by hunters or they will be torn apart by other wolves. <br>
 When two flocks meet they often fight a grinding battle in which the male leader is killed <br>
Sometimes their corpses are even eaten by their offspring, and this fact negates the belief that wolves do not eat carrion. <br> </p>

  <br> 4-Great weight
<br>Some of the heaviest wolves can weigh up to 90 kg, and the size of wolves increases exponentially as they are further from the equator <br>
and wolves of tropical regions are often not larger than medium-sized dogsbut wolves of the Far North can exceed (Alaska, Canada, Russia) 55 kg. <br>
The largest wolf ever killed in North America was in Alaska in 1939 with a weight of 80 kg. In the former Soviet Socialist Republic of Ukraine <br>
a more massive wolf with a weight of 86 kg was killed, there are unproven reports of samples exceeding 91 kg <br>
 often it may be for male leaders in regions with stable food sourcesand of course these weights <br>
 are almost more than the weight of the colossal Mastiff dog, which It is 55--90 kilograms. <br> </p>

    <br> 5-Rabid wolves
 <br>Rabid wolves are very dangerous even though they are not animals that usually catch rabies, but it can be transmitted to them by other species such as raccoons and foxes <br>
 Unlike some animals that display lethargy and disorientation, wolves almost instantly enter a state of extreme rage when they become ill. <br>
 It is clear that a large number of attacks on humans are directly related to rabies. However,<br>
such incidents have decreased dramatically over the years,but still a small number of them occur every year.<br>
Although there are clearly treatments available for people who are bitten by rabid animals <br>
 the wolf's tendency to bite near the head and neck often causes the virus to reach the brain before even seeking medical help. <br> </p>
 <p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="61968-6.jpg" alt="wolves6" height="400">
   <br> 6-American wolves
 <br> wolves in the Americas are less likely to attack humans than anywhere else in the world. There are very few records of wolf attacks in the United States and Canada <br>
 but in Europe and Asia wolves are much more ferocious, historical accounts indicate that more than 3,000 people were killed in France between 1580 and 1830 AD on wolf tusks <br>
In the Middle Ages, special structures were built along highways for travelers across Europe to protect from wandering herds <br>
The wolves of India and Russia are also particularly known for claiming a lot of human lives. During World War 1 <br>
soldiers from the Allied and Central Powers were sometimes forced to join forces that fought off hungry wolves drawn <br>
by the smell of blood on the battlefield. <br> </p>

  <br> 7-Eat dogs
<br>Wolves find dogs deliciously tasty, although they are closely related to them (almost the same type) and can mate easily, but many wolves view dogs as prey <br>
In a battle between the two, the wolf will outpace even the large dogs in general, as wolves have larger teeth and a more severe and dangerous bite. <br>
In Russia, where stray dogs have become a serious problem since the fall of the Soviet Union, they have become a staple of wolf food <br>
Often times a wolf will seduce a dog to follow, leading him into an ambush by the rest of the herd. Only the largest and fiercest cattle keepers <br>
like the Caucasian Terrier and the Tibetan Mastiff have a chance to defend themselves from this deadly animal. <br> </p>
